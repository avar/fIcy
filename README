General Description

	fIcy is a icecast/shoutcast stream grabber for use under shell
	environment.  Its goal is to cleanly and automatically rip a stream
	into user customizable files.  It will work with any ICY compatible
	stream, allowing you to either to save the stream to disk or to pipe
	the output to a media player, or even both.


Usage

	fIcy [options] <server [port [path]]|url>

	Options available: [-dehimnptr] [-o <prefix>] [-s <suffix>]

Options

	-d		Do not dump the output to stdout.
			Useful when only ripping.

	-e		Enumerate number of ripped files when song metadata
			changes. Uses -o as prefix.

	-h		Help

	-i		Ignore file creation errors (necessary when using -c).

	-m		Use song title [metadata] when naming files. Uses -o as
			prefix.

	-n		If the file exists create new one with .n as suffix.

	-p		When dumping and writing, continue even if SIGPIPE is
			received.  Useful when you pipe the output to a media
			player and want to kill it while not interrupting the
			rip.

	-o <file>	Dump the output to file.
			Hint: to dump without a prefix use "./"

	-s <suffix>	Use sfx as a suffix for new files.
			Hint: the .mp3 extension is NOT implicit.
			Hint: *any* extension is valid. fIcy is *not* limited
			to mp3 files.

	-t		Display song title [metadata] while ripping.

	-r		Remove/don't save partial chunks. This will skip the
			first chunk and remove the last one upon
			termination which are (supposedly) incomplete. To use
			in combination with -m or -e.


Examples:

	Use fIcy to display ICY titles while playing:

		fIcy -t 123.123.123.123 8080 | mpg123 -

	Rip an .mp3 stream using metadata as filename, with server:port
	and /path:

		fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -md 123.123.123.123 8080 /path/to/stream
	
	Rip an .mp3 stream and plays it using mpg123, allowing mpg123
	to be killed anytime:

		fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -mp 1.2.3.4 8080 /path/to/stream | mpg123 -

	URL parsing examples. Both "icy" and "http" are recognized as
	valid protocols, as well as nothing:

		fIcy -t icy://a.radio:8888/ | mpg123 -

		fIcy -t http://something.net/radio | mpg123 -

		fIcy -t mega.station | mpg123 -


DISCLAIMER:

	We would like to remind you that saving public streams without paying
	the rights is *ILLEGAL* unless explicitly stated.


Notes:

	The output files produced by fIcy may miss audio framing informations
	and headers since the separation does not consider the audio data. For
	this reason, your player may fail to reproduce the dump: this is
	expected. You can use other tools such as mp3fix for this.
