General Description

	fIcy is an icecast/shoutcast stream grabber for use under shell
	environment.  Its goal is to cleanly and automatically rip a stream
	into user customizable files.  It will work with any ICY compatible
	stream, allowing you to either to save the stream to disk or to pipe
	the output to a media player, or even both.


Usage

	fIcy [options] <server [port [path]]|url>

	Options available: [-dehimnptr] [-o <prefix>] [-s <suffix>]

	COPYING		License. Please read carefully.
	README		This file. Contains usage description.
	TODO		Missing/Planned improvements.


Options

	-d		Do not dump the output to stdout.
			Useful when only ripping.

	-e		Enumerate number of ripped files when song metadata
			changes. Uses -o as prefix.

	-h		Help

	-c		Do not clobber files.

	-i		Do not clobber files but abort when trying to do so
			(-c is implicit).

	-m		Use song title [metadata] when naming files. Uses -o as
			prefix.

	-n		If the file exists create new one with .n as suffix.

	-p		When duping consider writing errors as transient.
			Useful when you pipe the output to a media player and
			want to kill it while not interrupting the rip.

	-o <file>	Dump the output to file.
			Hint: to dump without a prefix use "./"

	-s <suffix>	Use sfx as a suffix for new files.
			Hint: the .mp3 extension is NOT implicit.
			Hint: *any* extension is valid. fIcy is *not* limited
			to mp3 files.

	-t		Display song title [metadata] while ripping.

	-r		Remove/don't save partial chunks. This will skip the
			first chunk and remove the last one upon
			termination which are (supposedly) incomplete. To use
			in combination with -m or -e.

	-q <file>	Append file sequence list to file. This may be used to
			rejoin splitted parts with an external tool.


Examples

	Use fIcy to display ICY titles while playing:

		fIcy -t 123.123.123.123 8080 | mpg123 -

	Rip an .mp3 stream using metadata as filename, with server:port
	and /path:

		fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -md 123.123.123.123 8080 /path/to/stream
	
	Rip an .mp3 stream and plays it using mpg123, allowing mpg123
	to be killed anytime:

		fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -mp 1.2.3.4 8080 /path/to/stream | mpg123 -

	Same as above, but allows the player to be restarted later by using
	a named fifo:

		mknod fifo
		fIcy -p ... > fifo
		mpg123 fifo

	URL parsing examples. Both "icy" and "http" are recognised as
	valid protocols, as well as nothing:

		fIcy -t icy://a.radio.invalid:8888/ | mpg123 -

		fIcy -t http://example.com/radio | mpg123 -

		fIcy -t mega.station | mpg123 -


Companion software:

	bfr <http://www.glines.org:8000/software/buffer.html>:
		Audio-oriented rebuffering tool. Ideal for lousy streams.

	mp3check <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3check/>:
		mp3 integrity checker.

	mp3asm <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3asm/>:
		Frame-level mp3 cutting tool.


DISCLAIMER

	We would like to remind you that saving public streams without paying
	the rights is *ILLEGAL* unless explicitly stated.


Notes

	The output files produced by fIcy may miss audio framing informations
	and headers since the separation does not consider the audio data. For
	this reason, your player may fail to reproduce the dump: this is
	expected. You can use other tools such as mp3asm for this. The audio
	quality is *not* diminished for the very same reason.

	For bugs, support, documentation or simply suggestions contact our
	"Concept Developer": SethX <sethx@users.sf.net>.
	The fIcy project is located at http://ficy.sf.net/


Installation

	fIcy comes with a very simple Makefile that should work on any system
	using gcc, or IRIX. GNU make or pmake is required. Documentation is
	generated from these files using ohg.
