General Description

	fIcy is a icecast/shoutcast stream grabber for use under shell
	environment.  Its goal is to cleanly and automatically rip a stream
	into user customisable files.  It will work with any ICY compatible
	stream, allowing you to either to save the stream to disk or to pipe
	the output to a media player, or even both.


Usage

	fIcy [options] <server> [port [path]]

	Options available: [-dehimnpt] [-o <prefix>] [-s <suffix>]

Options

	-d		Do not dump the output to stdout.
			Useful when only ripping.

	-e              Enumerate number of ripped files when song metadata
			changes. Uses -o as prefix.

        -h              Displays help

	-i              Ignore file creation errors (necessary when using -c).

	-m              Use song title [metadata] when naming files. Uses -o as
			prefix.

	-n              If the file exists create new one with .n as suffix.

	-p              When dumping and writing, continue even if SIGPIPE is
			received.  Useful when you pipe the output to a media
			player and want to kill it while not interrupting the
			rip.

	-o <file>	Dump the output to file.
			Hint: to dump without a prefix use "./"

	-s <suffix>	Use sfx as a suffix for new files
			Hint: the .mp3 extension is NOT implicit.
			Hint: *ANY* extension is valid. fIcy is NOT limited to
			mp3 files.

        -t              Display song title [metadata] while ripping.


Examples:

	fIcy -t 123.123.123.123 8080 | mpg123 -
		Use fIcy to display ICY titles while playing.

	fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -md 123.123.123.123 8080 /path/to/stream
		rips a .mp3 stream using metadata as filename, with server:port
		and /path .

	fIcy -s .mp3 -o ./ -mp 123.123.123.123 8080 /path/to/stream | mpg123 -
		rips a .mp3 stream and plays it using mpg123, allowing mpg123
		to be killed

	We would like to remind you that saving public streams without paying
