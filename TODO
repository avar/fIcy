Features:

	* fResync should have an option to check the entire file for errors
	instead of checking only the extremes.

	* fIcy should have an option to rewrite the filename (to strip out
	banners and so on).

Known bugs:

	* fResync isn't 100% effective yet. CRC verification and
	"bit reservoir" handling is lacking. Will be fixed in future
	release of fIcy.

	* fResync will deliberately remove any form of ID3v1 or v2 tag if
	run on a "sane" file.

	* Running fResync on a read-only file is still possible and in certain
	race conditions can remove the source file.

Internals:

	* OGG support isn't there yet.

	* Split the ICY class into ICE/OGG subclasses, to support
	seamless operation when using OGG streams.

	* Too much code depends on the order of evaluation of expressions.
