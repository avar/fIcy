SethX:

	* Add a time offset after which to change title, due to the
	"soft" mixing in many streams.

wave++:

	* When creation of a file fails for a bad path (probably a bad
	prefix was specified) abort anyway. The prefix should lead to an
	existent directory.

	* Split the ICY class into ICE/OGG subclasses, to support
	seamless operation when using OGG streams.

	* Change the semantics of -p (or add another flag), to make
	duping both non-blocking and non-fatal instead of signal
	based operations. This is more desiderable.
