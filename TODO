Features:

	* fResync should have an option to check the entire file for errors
	instead of checking only the extremes.

Known bugs:

	* fResync isn't 100% effective yet. CRC verification and
	"bit reservoir" handling is lacking. Will be fixed in future
	release of fIcy.

Internals:

	* OGG support isn't there yet.

	* Split the ICY class into ICE/OGG subclasses, to support
	seamless operation when using OGG streams.

	* Too much code depends on the order of evaluation of expressions.
