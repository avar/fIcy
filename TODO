Features

	* fResync should have an option to check the entire file for errors
	  instead of checking only the extremes.


Known bugs

	* fResync isn't 100% effective yet. CRC verification and
	  "bit reservoir" handling is lacking. Will be fixed in future
	  release of fIcy.

	* fResync will deliberately remove any form of ID3v1 or v2 tag if
	  run on a "sane" file.

	* There's no HDD fIcy can't fill.


Internals

	* OGG support isn't there yet.


	* Split the ICY class into ICE/OGG subclasses, to support
	  seamless operation when using OGG streams.

	* Use a virtual pty to remove the need of GNU sed.
